This is only intended to be used to share my work for a coding challenge.

To run, of course, don't forget to:

<code>npm install</code>

For development and testing, be sure to run:

<code>npm install --only=dev</code>

Run the code by simply running:

<code>node index.js</code>

It's as simple as that.

This application takes an existing JSON dataset and sets out to "identify the best marketing source, by dollar spent per lead cost, each quarter".
